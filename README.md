NOTE: <ol> 
<li>This is a personal project to learn about creating nlp units and the javascript programming and other node js packages.</li>
<li>In addition, instead of using other people's bots, such as groovy, fredboat, and ayana, I wanted to create and use my own bot.</li>
<li>It is not meant to be a professional project.</li>
<li>More features will be updated.</li>
<li>The bot is tested on the 3 most basic operating system platforms:<ol>
<li>MacOS</li>
<li>Windows</li>
<li>Linux</li>
</ol>
