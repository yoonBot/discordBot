### `NOTE:` 
#### 1. This is a personal project to learn about creating nlp units and the javascript programming and other node js packages.
#### 2. In addition, instead of using other people's bots, such as groovy, fredboat, and ayana, I wanted to create and use my own bot.
#### 3. It is not meant to be a professional project.
#### 4. More features will be updated.
#### 5. This bot is active online for 24/7 at heroku.
#### 6. The bot is tested on the 3 most basic operating system platforms:
##### a. MacOS
##### b. Windows
##### c. Linux
